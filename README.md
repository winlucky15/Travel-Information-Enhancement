# Travel-Information-Enhancement
This is a dataset with 100 images crawled from Flickr and 125 travelogues crawled from TripAdvisor. Each image is linked with the descriptive text which is composed of three components (title, tag, and description). The travelogue is composed of title, poster, and comment. 
The purpose of building this dataset is to supply a benchmark dataset to evaluate the performance of travelogue-image matching.
